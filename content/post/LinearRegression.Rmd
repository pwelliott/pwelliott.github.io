Linear Regression is a foundational topic in Statistics and Machine Learning. Countless books have been written on the topic, ranging from theory to tips for practitioners. In this post I aim to answer a few important questions:

* What is regression?
* What does it mean for it to be linear?
* How does it work?
* What can we learn when using Linear Regression?
* When should we be skeptical of results?

## What is Regression?
 
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
 
 You can embed an R code chunk like this:
 
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots
 
 You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:
 
```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
