The goal of this series of posts is to present some common methods in statistics and machine learning in a way that can help build intuition without an overwhelming amount of mathematical detail. My plan is to cover the following topics -- links will appear as posts go up:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Generalized Linear Models
* Decision Trees
* Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines
* Kernel Density Estimation and Regression
* Basis Methods for Non-parametric Regression
* Bayesian Methods
* Shrinkage and Sparsity
* Matrix Factorization
* Neural Networks

There's a lot to say about each of these topics -- enough to fill thousands of pages -- so my aim is only to scratch the surface. Some of these are methods I use on a daily basis; others I've learned about in courses or in my own reading and hopefully the process of writing about them will help me learn more.
