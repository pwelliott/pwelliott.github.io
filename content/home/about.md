# Biography

I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My research is focused on designing multivariate methods for analyzing neural time series, particularly from intracranial EEG. Statistically, these can be framed as methods for dimensionality reduction -- with the goal of describing covariation in neural activity -- and classification -- to assess neural responses to stimuli. 

I am also involved in the department's Teaching Statistics research group. The goal of the group is to improve undergraduate statistics education, including pedagogy, curriculum, and assessment of student learning.
